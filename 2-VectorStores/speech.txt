World War II was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945, involving virtually every part of the world. The war began when Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. This act of aggression prompted Great Britain and France to declare war on Germany.

The war escalated as Germany expanded its territorial control, invading Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France. Italy, led by Benito Mussolini, joined the war on Germanyâ€™s side in 1940. Japan, meanwhile, had been at war with China since 1937 and eventually entered the global conflict in December 1941, following the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

The Allies, comprising the United States, Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China, among others, fought against the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan). The war saw brutal battles on multiple fronts, including Europe, North Africa, and Asia.
